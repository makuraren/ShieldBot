# Commands
Since this is a new bot with no real method to organize commands right now, most commands are simple and not threatening right now. Keep in mind as I grow this list I will add specific notes to ensure these commands will not fall into the wrong hands.

## Owner-Specific Commands
### While few in numbers these do exist:

#### blacklist command
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command] {user id/mention user}_  
**Description:**  
_This command does absolutely nothing other than placing the persons id into a json file._  

***If the user's id is inside this document in Ver 0.1.1, they are still allowed to use regular commands.***

#### unblacklist command  
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command] {user id/mention user}_  
**Description:**  
_This command removes the user's id from the blacklist json file._  

***If the user's id is inside this document in Ver 0.1.1, they are still allowed to use regular commands.***


## User-Specific Commands
### These commands are made entirely for the user to enjoy. While most of my really fun ones are in a previous version not available for viewing, I will implement these when I begin to organize cogs into the bot. For now, here are a few commands active as of Ver 0.1.1:  
```
