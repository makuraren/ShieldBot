# Info
Since my journey in learning python began with a single college class, I took the liberty in making a new discord bot with a language I feel more comfortable with. Discord.py at least in my opinion works so much better than Discord.js since the ping in between events is insanely low. I hope this bot can one day be full of commands and little nifty tools for gamers and casual chatties can enjoy.
# Tasks
- [ ] offer more moderation control when more aggressive commands are made

# Commands
Since this is a new bot with no real method to organize commands right now, most commands are simple and not threatening right now. Keep in mind as I grow this list I will add specific notes to ensure these commands will not fall into the wrong hands.

## Owner-Specific Commands
While few in numbers these do exist:

### [blacklist]
>***This is only available to the owner and can not be used by anyone but the owner.***  
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command] {user id/mention user}_  
**Description:**  
_A command that blacklists a user_  

### [unblacklist]
>***This is only available to the owner and can not be used by anyone but the owner.***  
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command] {user id/mention user}_  
**Description:**  
_A command that unblacklists a user_  

### [logout]
>***This is only available to the owner and can not be used by anyone but the owner.***  
**Aliases**  
_{disconnect, close, stopbot}_  
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command]_  
**Description:**

### [clear]

**Aliases**  
_{purge}_  
**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command] (num)_  
**Description:**

## User-Specific Commands
These commands are made entirely for the user to enjoy. While most of my really fun ones are in a previous version not available for viewing, I will implement these when I begin to organize cogs into the bot. For now, here are a few commands active as of Ver 0.1.1:  

### [hi]  
>**Aliases**

**Format:**  
_(prefix)[command]_  
**Description:**  
_A simple command which says hi to the author._

### [stats]

### [echo]

_A simple command that repeats the users input back to them._

### [8ball]

# Contact Information
If you have any inquires or recommendations on what I should do, feel free to send me a message and I will add that to my tasks. This is suppose to be a fun project to keep my free time manageable.
