# Info
Since my journey in learning python began with a single college class, I took the liberty in making a new discord bot with a language I feel more comfortable with. Discord.py at least in my opinion works so much better than Discord.js since the ping in between events is insanely low. I hope this bot can one day be full of commands and little nifty tools for gamers and casual chatties can enjoy.

# Commands
Since this is a new bot with no real method to organize commands right now, most commands are simple and not threatening right now. Keep in mind as I grow this list I will add specific notes to ensure these commands will not fall into the wrong hands.

## Fun Commands
